## üîç **Troubleshooting**

### **If Voice Recommendation Doesn't Appear**

1. **Check Browser Console**:
   ```javascript
   // Open DevTools (F12) and look for errors
   // Should see the API response with voiceRecommendation field
   ```

2. **Check Backend Logs**:
   ```bash
   # Look for these log messages:
   "Analyzing speech for voice recommendation..."
   "Using recommended voice: [voice-id] with tone: [tone]"
   ```

3. **Check API Response**:
   ```bash
   # The /api/v1/analyze response should include:
   {
     "score": 7,
     "positiveFeedback": "...",
     "improvementPoints": "...",
     "audioUrl": "...",
     "voiceRecommendation": {
       "voiceOption": {
         "voiceId": "en-US-julia",
         "name": "Julia",
         "gender": "Female",
         "description": "..."
       },
       "recommendedTone": "confident",
       "recommendationReason": "...",
       "confidenceScore": 0.85
     }
   }
   ```

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

**Issue**: "VoiceAnalysisService not found"
```bash
# Solution: Rebuild the backend
./mvnw clean compile
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

**Issue**: Frontend shows TypeScript errors
```bash
# Solution: Restart the dev server
npm run dev
```

**Issue**: Voice recommendation card doesn't show
- Check if `feedbackData.voiceRecommendation` exists in browser console
- Verify the backend is returning the new field

**Issue**: Audio doesn't play
- Check if `audioUrl` is present in the response
- Verify Murf AI integration is working
- Original functionality should still work without voice recommendation
