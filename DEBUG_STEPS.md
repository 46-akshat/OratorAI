# 🔍 Debug Steps - Why Can't You See Transcribed Text

## ✅ **What I Fixed**

1. **✅ Added missing `spokenTranscript` field** to FeedbackData interface
2. **✅ Added detailed console logging** to track data flow
3. **✅ Added debug display** in Recorder component
4. **✅ Verified backend is returning spokenTranscript** in AnalysisResponse

## 🧪 **How to Debug**

### **Step 1: Test Your Current Setup**

1. **Open your frontend** (should be on http://localhost:8081)
2. **Open browser DevTools** (F12) and go to Console tab
3. **Record a speech** and watch the console logs
4. **Look for these messages**:
   ```
   Data received from backend: {score: 7, positiveFeedback: "...", spokenTranscript: "..."}
   Spoken transcript: "Your actual transcribed text here"
   Transcribed text set: "Your actual transcribed text here"
   Recorder component - transcribedText: "Your actual transcribed text here"
   ```

### **Step 2: Check What's Missing**

**If you see:**
- ✅ "Data received from backend" → Backend is working
- ❌ "No spokenTranscript in response" → Backend issue
- ✅ "Transcribed text set" → Data flow is working
- ❌ "Recorder component - transcribedText: null" → Component issue

### **Step 3: Quick Test API**

Open `test-api.html` in your browser and click "Test Backend API" to verify:
- Backend is responding
- Voice recommendation system is working

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior**

After recording and analysis completes, you should see:

### **In the Middle Column (Recorder)**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🎤 Delivery & Recording         │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ Recording complete. You can...  │
│                                 │
│ ┌─────────────────────────────┐ │
│ │ 📊 What You Said:           │ │
│ │ "Good morning everyone. I'm │ │
│ │ excited to present our..."  │ │
│ └─────────────────────────────┘ │
│                                 │
│ [Record Again]                  │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### **In the Right Column (Feedback)**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🏆 AI Feedback                  │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ Overall Score: 7/10             │
│                                 │
│ ✅ What Went Well               │
│ ⚡ Areas for Improvement        │
│ 🎤 Voice Recommendation        │ ← NEW!
│ 🔊 Audio Playback              │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 🔧 **If Still Not Working**

### **Check 1: Backend Logs**
Look for these in your backend console:
```
Starting full transcription and analysis process...
Analyzing speech for voice recommendation...
Using recommended voice: en-US-julia with tone: conversational
```

### **Check 2: Frontend Console**
Should show:
```
Data received from backend: {spokenTranscript: "...", voiceRecommendation: {...}}
Transcribed text set: "Your speech here"
```

### **Check 3: Network Tab**
- Open DevTools → Network tab
- Record speech
- Look for POST to `/api/v1/analyze`
- Check response contains `spokenTranscript` field

## 🎉 **Success Indicators**

You'll know it's working when:
- ✅ Middle column shows "What You Said:" with your transcribed text
- ✅ Right column shows voice recommendation card
- ✅ Audio player says "Hear Your Speech in Recommended Voice"
- ✅ Console shows all debug messages

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Test with the debug version** (has extra logging)
2. **Check browser console** for detailed logs
3. **Look for the yellow debug box** if transcription fails
4. **Report what you see** in the console logs

The transcribed text should now appear in the middle column after analysis completes!
